What's Sylpheed
===============

Sylpheed is an e-mail client and news reader based on GTK+ GUI toolkit,
and runs on X Window System.

Sylpheed is a free software distributed under the GNU GPL.

The development of Sylpheed sets the following things as its goal:

  * Quick response by keeping CPU and memory usage to a minimum
  * Fast processing even though a folder contains large number of messages
    (more than 10 thousand)
  * Enables intuitive operation by simple, graceful, and well-polished
    interface
  * Similar operation methods to other mailers.
  * Readily available with simple configuration
  * Fully equipped with features required as a mailer
  * Full support of Japanese, and support of i18n
  * Enables flexible interaction with external commands
  * Stable, and don't lose any data (to the utmost) in case of crash

The appearance and interface are similar to some popular e-mail clients for
Windows, such as Outlook Express, Becky!, and Datula. The interface is also
designed to emulate the Emacs-based mailers, and almost all commands are
accessible with the keyboard. So you will able to migrate to Sylpheed
without much discomfort in the case where you are accustomed to other
mailers.

The messages are managed by MH format, and you'll be able to use it together
with another mailer based on MH format (like Mew). It has less possibility
of losing mails on failures since one file corresponds to one mail. You can
import or export mbox format messages. You can also utilize fetchmail or/and
procmail, and external programs on receiving (like inc or imget).

Installation
============

See INSTALL for installation instructions.

Usage
=====

Preparation before running
--------------------------

If you are using a character encodings other than UTF-8 for filename,
you must set the following environmental variable:

(use locale-specific encoding)
% export G_FILENAME_ENCODING=@locale

or

(manually specifying encoding)
% export G_FILENAME_ENCODING=ISO-8859-1

If you want to display messages translated to your language,
you must specify some environmental variables related to locale.
For example:

% export LANG=de_DE

(replace de_DE to the actual locale name)

If you don't want translated messages, set LC_MESSAGES to "C"
(and unset LC_ALL if specified).

How to run
----------

Input `sylpheed' on a command line, or double-click the icon on a file
manager to execute.

Initial startup
---------------

When Sylpheed is executed for the first time, it automatically creates the
configuration files under ~/.sylpheed-2.0/, and asks you the location of
mailbox. The default is ~/Mail. If some files which are non-MH format
already exist on the directory, you will have to specify another location.

If ~/.sylpheed-2.0/ doesn't exist, but the previous version of configuration
exists in ~/.sylpheed/, migration will be made automatically after the
confirmation.

Required settings
-----------------

Initially, you have to create at least one account to send or receive
messages (you can read messages that already exist without creating
accounts). The configuration dialog will be shown by clicking
"Configuration -> Create new account..." on the menu, or "Account" on
the toolbar. Then, fill the required settings.

Refer to the manual supplied with this program for the general usage.

Hidden settings
---------------

You can configure most of the features in Sylpheed through the preferences
dialog, but there are a few parameters which don't have user interface
(you don't have to modify them in normal use). You must edit
~/.sylpheed-2.0/sylpheedrc by an editor when Sylpheed is not running.

allow_jisx0201_kana		allow JIS X 0201 Kana (half-width kana) on
				sending.
				0: off  1: on   [default: 0]
enable_hscrollbar		enable horizontal scroll bar in summary view
				0: off  1: on	[default: 1]
bold_unread			show unread messages using bold font in
				summary view
				0: off  1: on   [default: 1]
folderview_vscrollbar_policy	specify the policy of vertical scroll bar
				of folder view
				0: always  1: automatic  2: never [default: 0]
