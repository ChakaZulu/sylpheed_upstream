<H2><A NAME="s3">3. Sylpheed FAQ - Interface</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Q01  How do I make Sylpheed display my language?</A>
</H2>

<P>A.   You have to set some environment variables such as
<CODE>LANG,LC_CTYPE, LC_MESSAGES</CODE> to your local language.
Usually <CODE>LANG</CODE> (or <CODE>LC_ALL</CODE>) is sufficient.
<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Q02  I don't like the default font. Can I change that?</A>
</H2>

<P>A.   Yes. In Configuration&gt;common preferences under the
"Display" tab.
<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Q03  There are too many columns in the message list!!</A>
</H2>

<P>A.   In Configuration&gt;common preferences under the
"Display" tab you can press the button "Set display
item of summary". That pops up a screen with all the
options you can show or leave out of the message
list.
<H2><A NAME="ss3.4">3.4 Q04  Can I use a different editor to write my mails?</A>
</H2>

<P>A.   You can. In Configuration&gt;common preferences under
the "Other" tab you can define your editor of choice.
Remember, if you want to use a command line editor
like vi or emacs, to write the name of the shell
(term, term, rxvt) with the -e parameter in front of
the editor. E.g.: <CODE>rxvt -e vi %s</CODE>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.5">3.5 Q05  How to change the font size in the Sylpheed interface?</A>
</H2>

<P>A.   You can set the GTK+ font by <CODE>~/.gtkrc</CODE>, or
<CODE>~/.gtkrc.mine</CODE>,
(which is included by <CODE>~/.gtkrc</CODE>).
For example:
<CODE>style "default"
{
font =
"-adobe-helvetica-medium-r-normal--12-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1
"
}
widget_class "*"        style "default"</CODE>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.6">3.6 Q06  Sylpheed saves my outgoing mail (in Outbox). Can I make it stop doing that?</A>
</H2>

<P>A.   In Configuration&gt;common preferences there's a
checkbox "Save sent message to outbox". Uncheck it,
and it's solved.
<H2><A NAME="ss3.7">3.7 Q07  How can I change the key-bindings (hot-keys) in Sylpheed?</A>
</H2>

<P>A.   That is very simple. Suppose you want to assign a
shortcut key to a function, e.g. sending all mail
out should start when you press Ctrl-Y. Click the
Message' menu and move the mouse over "Send all
messages". Now you press Ctrl-Y. Immediately the menu
text is updated and the function is in place. Please
note that a previous function that Ctrl-Y was
assigned to, will no longer have a shortcut key. If
you want to remove the key binding, do the same
thing, but press the "delete" key on the menu-item.
Then the key binding is removed.
<H2><A NAME="ss3.8">3.8 Q08  Can I close windows without the mouse?</A>
</H2>

<P>A.   Of course!! Not all windows, but by pressing ESCape,
you can close the addressbook, the window of viewing
a mail-source (message&gt;view source), the window of
viewing the headers, and several others. Just give
it a try and you will find all of them.
<H2><A NAME="ss3.9">3.9 Q09  Can I change the way the date is displayed in the message summary?</A>
</H2>

<P>A.   As of 0.4.65 you can. The options are:
%y = year in numbers     %m = month in number
%d = day in numbers      %c = date/time for locale
%A = full weekday name   %a = short month name
%B = full month name     %b = short month name
%H = hours in 24-clock   %I = hours in 12-clock
For more information go to the configuration menu,
select Common preferences / Display and move the
mouse cursor over the input box for the date display
format.
<H2><A NAME="ss3.10">3.10 Q10  Why can't I see the compface pictures?</A>
</H2>

<P>A.   You need to enable displaying of the header pane in the
general preferences
<H2><A NAME="ss3.11">3.11 Q11  I still can't see the pictures. Why not?</A>
</H2>

<P>A.   You may not have compiled in Compface support. See Q11
in the Installation/Configuration section.
<H2><A NAME="ss3.12">3.12 Q12  Why does the URL Launcher not launch my webbrowser?</A>
</H2>

<P>A.   You need to double-click the url.
<H2><A NAME="ss3.13">3.13 Q13 Attachments with spaces in the name won't open!</A>
</H2>

<P>A.   When you try to launch a helper application, like an image viewer, with an attachment that has spaces in the name, put quotes around the %s
parameter. Example: gedit '%s'
